# MXChip Direction
This application is a simple example of using the magnetometer built into the MX CHip. By adding the current magnetic deviation for your location on the earht, 
we can calculate direction. This application will calculate direction in real time. By setting the deviation in the code it will display the direction you are pointing the MXChip
